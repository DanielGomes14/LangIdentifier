As I have already explained, all the matters discussed at that time are linked to national competence.
As a Bulgarian politician, I am following with particular interest the developments concerning the intermediate category of beneficiary regions, which is planned to be created in the new 2013-2020 budget framework.
As a result of the provision on revision the co-legislators can make informed decisions because the Commission will conduct an in-depth survey on further compulsory labelling requirements.
As an example, as Mr Audy reminded us, we have already implemented three concrete simplification measures for FP7: more use of average personnel costs, easier procedures for owner-managers of SMEs, and a clearing committee to ensure a common interpretation of the rules.
As far as the radio spectrum is concerned, our policy must have realistic yet ambitious objectives so that European companies are able to compete in the world market on a sounder footing.
As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost their lives since January.
As part of the mechanism for cooperation in the area of nuclear safety, we are considering a project aimed at helping the most significantly affected population groups around the Chernobyl exclusion zone.
As regards the 2012 budget, I would like to point out that the draft budget that was adopted by the Commission on 20 April is in line with the European Council conclusions of 24 and 25 March, which state that fiscal consolidation efforts must be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms.
As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular importance to me. In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly hindered from fulfilling their basic role - the reliable and credible provision of information.
As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy.
As the primary role of the IMF is to work on conditional structural reform packages to accompany the distribution of funds to members when they are in dire straits, I believe that Ms Lagarde has shown that she is well able to broker complex agreements on controversial issues, successfully bringing together disparate parties to reach a beneficial solution.
As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement, the MFF must provide for properly balanced expenditure.
As with Mr Lyon's report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo's report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...
Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any, or hardly any, proof.
At a time when the EU has already understood that greater coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary policy are both necessary, the idea that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance seems an extremely relevant one to me.
At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the EU, mainly Russia.
At the present time, attention is mainly paid to implementation of the EU Action Plan for 2009-2012, which is aimed at strengthening European cooperation in the struggle against the unacceptable consequences of drug addiction. I would like to see the Centre working not only on the consequences but also on the causes of drug addiction, thus solving the problem at an early stage. I voted in favour.
At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market.
At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these external costs.
At times of crisis, investment is needed in jobs and development.
Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out.
Because of Lisbon, investment treaties can become an instrument for the Commission's political objectives - and not just the Commission's: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will try to advance their political programme, and we have seen that in the trade treaties time after time.
Better use can be made of the forest in this fight, not only through preventing felling, but also through afforestation and reforestation programmes.
Both sides are also significant investors in each other's economy, with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009.
Businesses in Europe must remain competitive.
But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration.
By 'European family', I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part.
By giving children the ability to realise their potential, quality education and care structures can contribute significantly to achieving two of the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing early school drop-out rates below 10% and lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion.
By the way, temporary border controls were introduced on the basis of the Schengen regime of 2006 for the European Football Championship and for the football World Cup as a defence against hooliganism.
Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
Cohesion policy after 2013 should continue to be an important factor in the development of Europe.
Commissioner Malmström, leave Schengen as it is. Re-read the Treaties, re-read Articles 67 and 78. Everything is there.
Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation.
Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating performances, with this information then being passed on to the supervisor.
Considering the significant economic returns from such programmes, I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by 2018, thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the American system.
Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy (short presentation)
Countries that fail to meet the obligations in the preventive and corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact may be subject, unless they take appropriate measures (the suitability of which will be decided by the Council) and present a rebalancing plan, to the application of financial sanctions equal to 0.1% of GDP.
Crucial elements in that policy would be support for the work of the UN and a clarification of the EU's policy with regard to the UN.
Cutting expenses hurts, but remains the only way back to growth and stability.
Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed, which we regret.
Despite the ongoing fighting and its spread to various parts of Libya, humanitarian organisations are doing a remarkable job in preventing a major humanitarian disaster.
Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands, but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations.
Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding 'No'. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion.
During the debate, one of our fellow Members said that letting Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen would be a childish decision. I totally disagree. I believe that when we become adults, we appreciate rational arguments, and if we have been well educated, we recognise when rational arguments are fair.
Earlier, we discussed Mr Coelho's report and the need to safeguard Schengen as one of the most beautiful achievements of the European Union.
Either these countries will look only to China or to Russia, or they will at least have a chance to look towards Europe. I believe that this is important.
Environmental protection is one of the European Union's priorities.
Europe must be involved here at an earlier stage. I do not believe that we have learnt the right lessons from the crises of the 1990s.
European Investment Bank, European Commission, we are actually asking for an investigation into the activities of the European Investment Bank towards the end of September this year so that we can start the next discharge procedure with proper documentation.
European regulation of the issue which you are rightly complaining about on the basis of practical experience was not wanted at the time.
Even now, the majority of Indian foreign investment is situated in the European Union and the Tata Group alone is a leading employer in the industrial sector in Great Britain.
Every country should have the right to focus on the concerns of its citizens, including food security, the environment, reservations about genetic modification and the needs of rural areas, in order to support sustainable agriculture in Europe.
Experience shows that in many cases, project ideas emerge on the basis of available funding, instead of being based on real needs and on strategic priorities.
Finally it is also aimed at incorporating within international negotiations the rights of workers, which the International Labour Organisation is tasked with defending, as well as promoting a global economic governance that takes these parameters into account.
Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive.
Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union.
Finally, my other question relates to the timing, and you spoke about the difficulty with the Commission and the budgetary authority.
Finally, we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes.
First of all, I would like express my sincerest gratitude to Baroness Ashton for the EU's full support to Estonia in trying to resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
Firstly that Objective 1 funds, for the convergence regions, not be reduced - I would even like to see them increased - by the savings made as a result of certain regions no longer being under Objective 1. These savings must benefit the new intermediary regions of course, but also the other regions.
Firstly, the Commission, Member States and their organisations must provide consumers with information upstream.
Fishermen's incomes are also dependent on the price of oil.
Following the positive results of the evaluations and follow-up visits by teams of experts, it can be concluded that although some issues remain outstanding and regular reports and future follow-up visits are being demanded, these do not constitute an obstacle to the full accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area.
For example, EUR 34 billion left the six Irish domestic banks in the last three months of 2010, forcing them to rely on what is supposedly short-term funding from the ECB to the tune of EUR 160 billion.
For example, we need a clear definition of whistleblowing, we need whistleblowers to have a right to be heard, we need independent points of contact that can provide information on rights, obligations and options, and not least we also need precise handling deadlines for the competent EU institutions.
For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action, and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union's existence.
For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.
For their part, entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to offer new quality services, which will stimulate the development of the common European economy.
For this reason, Member States should ensure that vocational education and training is better adjusted to the needs of the labour market, and that vocational education provides employees with the skills needed to take up new, sustainable jobs that will be created in the future sustainable economy. I consider the role of local governments, entrepreneurial partnerships and educational institutions important in the development of the labour market demands of vocational education and training.
For us, if the European Union is to progress, it needs to develop a policy based on principles of peace, detached from military means and interventions, and to promote the demilitarisation of international relations.
Fourthly, in addition to all the cultural, social, religious and foreign policy concerns, the accession of Turkey would place a massive burden on the Cohesion Fund.
From the Lithuanian border, it will be possible to see the chimneys of one of these power plants just as clearly as we can we the tower of Strasbourg Cathedral from Parliament.
Further there will be a prohibition of so called pre-ticked boxes causing problems especially in the passenger travel sector.
Furthermore, entrepreneurs, managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the creative sector, need better access to financing opportunities, because we currently have too little know-how and too little access to bank finance.
Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of dependency on imports from third countries (60%), producers have very little or even no influence on the price levels of fisheries products. I agree that the ceiling on de minimis aid should be raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for a transitional period of three years, while ensuring that environmental and social sustainability are not undermined and that competition between Member States is not distorted.
Furthermore, the way in which this approach penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States, countries of origin, departure or destination of goods, for the benefit of 'central' and transit countries, is unacceptable.
Georgia has practically eliminated the cancer of corruption in state institutions and the civil service by means of a series of public sector reforms (concerning the public prosecutor's office, the judiciary and the police) and political reforms.
Given that the main economic activities in Seychelles are fishing and tourism, and that this agreement benefits both the EU and the Republic of Seychelles, in view of the creation of 3 000 jobs in Seychelles and 760 in Europe and the monitoring of catches through a multiannual sectoral programme which provides for scientific cooperation and the promotion of responsible and sustainable fisheries, I am voting in favour of this proposal for a recommendation.
Given the results of the referendum, the will of the people of South Sudan is now unequivocally in favour of independence, as has been repeatedly reiterated for many years now.
Greater consistency is needed in EU development aid and cooperation policy, particularly with regard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
Has a reform in your criminal justice system been considered so that prosecutors have some discretion as to whether to issue an arrest warrant and do not have to pursue every single complaint? In that way, the famous small offences like the stolen piglet would not be so much of a problem.
He has all the requisites for being an excellent President of the European Central Bank.
Here is a country that has not really moved forward in terms of political rights since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Honourable Members, I hope that the avenues and initiatives I have indicated will be followed up with effective action within the Member States.
How should we classify the middle-class protests in the Arab countries? The underlying causes are both political and economic.
However, I am not here to discuss what should be agreed among competent Members of the Commission and the International Monetary Fund with the participation of the Greek authorities.
However, I regret the shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets' inventory identified by the Court of Auditors but note the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts; considers that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites.
However, I would like us to establish more precisely what overall cost savings the Union will achieve as a result of environmental improvements and to present these figures.
However, as regards trade relations between the European Union and third countries, there remain profound differences in terms of social protection systems, as well as of working conditions.
However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way and, therefore, we need the time to do this.
However, in order to ensure regional cooperation does not serve merely as an excuse to delay decisions, we have added a whole raft of requirements which such cooperation should meet.
However, it is essential to put theory into practice, especially when it comes to mobilising enough financial resources through Union support programmes and measures to enable the monitoring of forests' ecological and phytosanitary state and, wherever necessary, their reclassification, including reforestation.
However, more needs to be done to make improvements in this area and it is for this reason that I supported this report.
However, that must be the subject of proper legal proceedings.
However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development - otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics.
However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments'. It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely 'to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it'. In other words, what the report does is put education and training fully at the beck and call of European capitalism.
However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe's major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy.
However, this report has enabled us to verify that measures that can be taken within the framework of international trade probably cannot be dealt with as urgently as these acts require, so we should learn for the future.
However, we cannot fail to point out some doubts that remain - arising from other fisheries partnership agreements - about the effectiveness of the stated objectives of cooperation on sustainable development in the sector for the third country in question, and on the sustainability and monitoring of their fishing activities.
However, we still have a lot to do to make life easier for SMEs with respect to the red tape they are faced with and access to funding that is often difficult.
Hungarians also have the right to adopt a constitution which makes no mention of an ombudsman or a personal data representative.
I also appeal from this Chamber to the football authorities in Romania to reverse this decision and allow Politehnica Timişoara to remain in top-flight Romanian and European football.
I am calling for a little more flexibility for the Member States. I am also calling for the Commission to analyse my request thoroughly and to understand the concerns of an entire sector, which must be preserved and developed.
I am in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area. A detailed and objective assessment of both countries' compliance with the Schengen acquis has been completed.
I am sorry if there is a false impression about the Commission's views on Schengen. I do not think I have spoken about anything other than Schengen for the last month! I have emphasised how important Schengen is, what a gift it is to the European Union and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it.
I am voting for this proposal, given that the report has achieved a balanced approach between the most important issues for the organisation and the activities of the European External Action Service, and for the key areas of security and defence policy.
I am voting in favour of this resolution, which relates to a chapter of the European commercial policy that should be taken as a model for negotiations with other countries - including India, China and Pakistan - which certainly do not guarantee fair competition, let alone respect for social rights and environmental standards, as Canada does.
I believe that the example shown by the aerospace industry in Northern Ireland is a significant one - larger companies mentoring and helping smaller companies to actually access the programme - and I would use this opportunity to call upon the Commissioner to provide us with radical and new ways for small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from this very important programme.
I can only be in favour of the choice to put Mario Draghi forward as the new President of the European Central Bank (ECB) for an eight-year term beginning next November.
I do not agree with the proposal to charge heavy goods vehicles according to air and noise pollution. I feel that it would be inappropriate to create yet another additional tax burden for hauliers, who have been badly affected by the financial crisis.
I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this.
I have finished my four minutes and I want to keep some time for the end of this debate, so I would just like to end by saying that in this time of austerity and times of economic difficulties, we must make sure that early years is still on the agenda and we still do what needs to be done in this important area.
I have voted in favour of the agreement as it is intended to ensure that trade takes place with a high level of customs security and that a set of standards ever closer to the EU acquis is applied.
I move on now to explain my vote on the Directive on Consumer Rights. I welcome the adoption of this directive, which constitutes a step forward in European integration and in the protection of consumer rights but, at the same time, I regret that the adoption of a number of articles of the directive involves taking protection away from many Spanish consumers and users who are going to find themselves deprived of certain rights that were already enshrined in Spanish law.
I served four terms as a member of parliament for a region, one area of which, namely Naoussa, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the whole of Europe, as a result of the impact of globalisation of the textile industry.
I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union, particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between Member States, including - sadly - criminals. I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many.
I support this report, which calls on the Member States to ensure that people, at different times of life, have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally.
I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States' discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution.
I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU's external borders.
I view the assessment made by the Court of Auditors in these special reports positively, because it is through these reports that we are able to access more clearly the information relating to how funds are spent, and also the need to reassess or adapt programmes and projects.
I voted against this report, which draws cultural goods into a logic of the market and competition.
I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future, because it tables proposals that respond to new challenges like food security, environmental protection and climate change, whilst simultaneously ensuring greater territorial balance in Europe's rural areas.
I voted for this report because the committee responsible considers that, in giving the interview in question, Luigi de Magistris was acting in the performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents.
I voted for this resolution which urges the Commission to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the SESAR Joint Undertaking because that recently formed undertaking has convinced the Court of Auditors of its reliability.
I voted in favour of the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash between euro area Member States. I voted in favour of it because I consider that extending the scope of the regulation is necessary and will resolve problems relating to the safety of the personnel responsible for transportation.
I voted in favour of the report on the creation of a European law of contract for consumers and businesses which will help to facilitate cross-border transactions and strengthen the Internal Market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 86/415/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the installation, location, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is very important to continuously improve the quality of EU law making, and this report sets out concrete proposals for improving the law making process both within the European Parliament and the Commission.
I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union.
I voted to give discharge to Eurojust and congratulate the agency for establishing measures to estimate the market value of relevant products/services before commencing a procurement procedure. I consider this initiative an important practice to be followed by other agencies. I welcome, in addition, the agency's annual procurement plan for 2009 which greatly helped Eurojust's units and services in the management of their tenders. I consider that these initiatives improve the authorising officer's guidance and control.
I want to inform the Commission and the Council that this is the start of Parliament's campaign to win new rights for our citizens who are the victims of fraud.
I welcome the Commission communication on the SBA review as it deals, to a large extent, with the problems which SMEs are faced with and for which European and national policies will have to come up with a solution.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, as I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome your statement today on Bosnia and Herzegovina - that was a fine statement, but you have failed to appoint a head for the delegation in Sarajevo.
I would add that Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation does not exclude domestic workers, so no amendment is needed for the ratification of the ILO Convention.
I would congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which has resulted in a report enabling us to start drawing up the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period, which constitutes a challenge for the Commission and for the Council.
I would like to give Mr Oettinger my support and encourage him to submit an ambitious proposal on the subject of energy efficiency in two weeks. I am very happy with the parts that we already know about, which are a mix of incentives and obligations for those affected. I do not like the fact that the Member States are supposed to set their own goals.
I would like to take up the subject once again of what is wrong in Greece, because I think that Mr Daul has a responsibility towards Nea Dimokratia.
I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result that has just been achieved due to an effort at finding a compromise between all the groups in an ambitious and encouraging report.
If a 28th regime procedure is going to be instituted, in keeping with this report, this would facilitate cross-border credit-based transactions.
If not, your conscience and this Chamber will hold you to account.
If the costs of the umpteenth strategy will still only finance talk, I call on the European institutions to make amends to the dozens of small entrepreneurs in my region, Veneto, who have taken their lives rather than see their small businesses fail.
If they are to enjoy uninterrupted connection, they must have radio frequencies dedicated entirely to them.
If we can get free elections and a new government in place, the European Union, in conjunction with other international bodies, particularly the African Union, can help nurture this country along on the road to democracy and the road to economic recovery.
If we really want these delegations to prevent development money ending up in the wrong hands or to prevent money leaking away into failing projects, then EU delegations will need more staff.
If you had been listening you would have heard that it fell.
Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future, as they show the possible consequences of their policy options.
In 2004, when the Erasmus Mundus exchange programme was launched, with the help of a large majority in this Parliament, I got the European Commission to agree to take the necessary measures to ensure quality in this programme. A 'European Quality Charter for Mobility' was even created.
In Europe, there are contractual forms that affect immigrants and women in this area of domestic service which are very precarious and contain major loopholes.
In a changing world, our Union needs to be more than a purely economic Union.
In accordance with the EU guidelines on the death penalty, we are exerting strong pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty at a national level, and at the level of the US federal states, and we are calling for a pardon in individual cases.
In addition, allowance has been made for the possibility of a certain dependence of tolls on vehicle movement (road congestion) at peak hours - for a maximum, however, of five hours a day. I think that this solution will successfully encourage avoidance of the use of some sections of road during peak hours.
In addition, the young generation needs a consistent strategy on mobility for increasing development in the area of science and culture. I support measures for cultural diplomacy, which can also be helped by the work of parliamentary delegations.
In any case, we had a tough struggle.
In connection with the evacuation drill which took place during voting time, today, all explanations of positions adopted at today's vote will be heard tomorrow - they will be heard together with tomorrow's explanations of vote.
In fact, I have a lot of faith in that.
In fact, the directives entail a substantial increase in EU interference in the internal economic affairs of Member States, which suggests a sharp decline in the latter's influence.
In its most recent report on these matters (February 2011), the Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the way the judiciary, police and other investigative bodies are structured, managed and cooperate.
In my country and throughout Europe, there are families who struggle to feed and educate their children and do not even consider having a computer, never mind high speed broadband.
In my opinion, the area where there is greatest room for improvement is in public awareness. I think it is inadequate and irresponsible to inform citizens on a given day about which food they should not buy or which food looks suspicious.
In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public.
In order to address and resolve this problem, Mrs Reding plans to issue a communication by the end of the year which will report on the status of the implementation of the existing directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising and on the current opportunities for revising it and which will provide an evaluation of the situation.
In order to meet citizens' needs, Parliament has proposed to create, in the context of the Structural Funds, a new category of regions where GDP per capita is between 75% and 90% of the Union's GDP.
In other words, the people should not interfere in the machinations of a process of which they are the victims. I will never allow the Commission to attack France. I am voting against this report.
In particular, I would like to stress the necessity of conducting a review of existing programmes with a cultural component and of drafting a Green Paper and a communication from the Commission outlining concrete policies for the role of culture in the EU's external actions.
In particular, these directives propose to strengthen surveillance mechanisms in a stringent manner in order to prevent any more Greek-style financial crises within the Union.
In relation to my report, Baroness Ashton, I would particularly like you to take note of paragraph 6, which calls for the drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European Union's role in international organisations through to 2020.
In spite of the restrictions and bans which have been introduced, much illegal fishing goes on, or even fishing that can be considered pillaging.
In the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' (COM(2009) 433 final), it is acknowledged that 'GDP has also come to be regarded as a proxy indicator for overall societal development and progress in general' but 'does not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion'. In a world in which people's quality of life is increasingly measured using other, non-economic factors, various international institutions, like the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are currently studying the definition of new indicators, so as to measure and analyse economic and social progress.
In the case of Belarus, it is not possible to fulfil this aim in its entirety due to the measures adopted.
In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently. I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level.
In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure.
In the near future, there will be other power stations in other Member States which will need to be halted because they are reaching the end of their operational life.
In the same connection, it is natural that the reform and harmonisation of product labelling should be assessed overall, as has now been agreed.
In this case, it seems that things went wrong.
In this context, the Commission will examine measures to reduce excessive dependence on external ratings, improve transparency, promote competition, introduce the principle of liability and reduce the risk of potential conflicts of interest due to the issuer-pays payment model.
In this regard, it should be said that the European Arrest Warrant responds to a need, particularly in view of the fact that it is not only honest citizens who mostly take advantage of the freedom to move around the European Union, but also criminals, who do not by any means exercise their rights for tourism or business purposes, but for criminal activities, or to avoid being brought to justice in their own country or in the country in which they committed the crime.
In this respect, it will be essential to achieve the full engagement of public and local authorities. A fundamental objective of innovation is to maintain a high level of prosperity in Europe. I hope the joining of forces which has been proposed will contribute to support for the process of innovation and help bring about economic stabilisation.
In this way, we can also contribute - thanks to the technologies and the agricultural techniques that will be used by farmers - not only to ensuring economic competitiveness, but also to reducing the impact of agricultural activity on climate change.
In view of the fact that CO2 emissions know no borders, and that after production is transferred emissions will continue, which will unavoidably have a negative impact on the environment, the European Union economy will lose out, since it is exporting jobs.
In view of this, I voted in favour of this report, as it will allow the Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road users for some limited external costs, with the aim of introducing the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport.
Indeed, I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human rights violations, in particular, concerning human rights defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping mission, who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten.
Indeed, the conclusions of the scientific opinion given by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) at the end of 2007 are based on data concerning the slaughter of animals in abattoirs and which are not reliable with regard to seal hunting.
Information and communications technology (ICT) is important in all innovative activity. ICT skills depend on improvements in the quality of training, support for lifelong learning, and the opportunity for those already in employment to update their own knowledge and skills continuously.
Instead of lengthening the pain and piling even more burdens on the Greek economy, it would be far better to accept the inevitable and the judgment of the markets.
Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure: see Minutes
Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia's democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections - there must be progress there.
It also criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund, and stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA).
It believes this measure to be long overdue, and that budgetisation of the EDF should take place at the earliest possible date.
It discusses funding for Roma communities, a subject that my political party has always opposed, and the allocation of large amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the European Union in the direction of the Western Balkans, another point with which I do not agree.
It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member State should reflect and comply with the European values of freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human dignity and respect of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, without discrimination, as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty.
It has not been possible to achieve this ambitious goal. I hope that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will be met, in particular, the EU's commitment to invest 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in research and development by 2020.
It is a fact that, in Europe, we have too little funding for higher education.
It is a very positive development that the adoption of this directive will end the situation in Estonia in which vehicles from other countries do not pay the tax in Estonia, but our vehicles pay in other countries.
It is also essential in increasing competitiveness as the EU overcomes the economic crisis.
It is also vital for governments to be able to undertake stimulus spending, as the Labour government did in 2008/2009, to prevent this crisis from turning into a global depression.
It is both mandatory and normal practice in Germany for a legal entity to register its address in an online directory when it is founded.
It is crucial, in fact, to continue along this path in order to furnish the European Union with the tools to compete with and face its main trade partners, such as the United States, Canada, China and Japan, on the globalised market.
It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and skills.
It is good that the submitted directive emphasises better quality supervision and controls, but especially the greater transparency of these processes and public participation.
It is important that this agreement be adopted, as Croatia is one of the main transit routes through which illicit drugs are smuggled into the EU, so it is vital that this country be involved in the EMCDDA's work as soon as possible, particularly bearing in mind that Croatia's accession to the EU is envisaged for the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.
It is impossible to accept that MEPs will not be subject to public scrutiny regarding the interests they defend in their role, or the pressure they are subject to or who is putting them under pressure. I therefore very much welcome the introduction of the common register of lobbyists and lobbying organisations.
It is more difficult but more beneficial for the people of Europe to make progress in this area.
It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start.
It is not surprising that the report should conclude that a single European solution is not possible.
It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things.
It is quite simply necessary to have these bilateral agreements, and therefore I welcome them.
It is the case that, in waiting for the implementation of a genuine common diplomacy and a genuine European defence policy, European soft power and its cultural diplomacy are some of the few means of influence at our disposal.
It is therefore extremely important that the checking and assessment of the European reactors does not become a paper tiger, but that it really is a proper assessment.
It is these citizens and their well-being that should be the main focus of democratisation, political pluralism, and respect for human rights and for religious, cultural and ethnic diversity in both South and North Sudan.
It is unacceptable that, in the face of the extremely severe crisis affecting the most vulnerable economies in the EU, they are continuing to make unsupportable cofinancing demands for the use of Union funds, specifically the Structural Funds.
It is vital that the international community maintains its presence and a very high level of humanitarian involvement.
It is, however, not at all obvious that with an additional own resource that would reduce the dependence on GNI, we can expect a revolution in EU capacities to finance growth and structural change.
It must ensure the highest possible level of European added value, it must be sensibly managed and it must support public and private resources as far as possible.
It recognises the important role that regional and local governments play in shaping European legislation, and therefore clearly differentiates between lobbyists and local and regional government officials.
It should be a key element of public policy in such areas as the environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education.
It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries.
It was also found that there was a lower take-up of fishing opportunities by long-liners, which led to a reduction in this segment in the current report.
It will be a comprehensive programme of technical assistance focused on growth and jobs, but with an emergency character because - I repeat - Greece is living in an emergency situation.
It would appear that this text also allows the right to abortion in Hungary to be restricted by stating, and I quote, 'that the life of the foetus will be protected from the time of conception'. The Hungarian Government has backed up its words by action in this area by launching an anti-abortion communication campaign which would still, apparently, appear to be using funds from the European PROGRESS programme (Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity).
Its accession to the World Trade Organisation will create numerous opportunities in economic relations between the European Union and Russia.
This directive is designed to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework and draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, regardless of the perspectives of nuclear power and non-power applications.
This extension is aimed at addressing the widespread economic crisis, given that terminating trade preferences would compromise these countries' economic recovery, and would have consequences for the whole stabilisation and transition process of the Western Balkans.
This grants the Executive Director of the European Network and Information Security Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
This includes the harmonisation of size labelling, social economic labelling and, most worryingly, a radio frequency identification tag which would increase costs for business and prices for the consumer.
This is a forward-looking draft report, and while it is not the finished article, it is undoubtedly a way of safeguarding the legitimacy of the activities and decisions of the European institutions.
This is a time to try to understand each other's problems but also respect each other's differences.
This is an initiative of the Committee on International Trade, of which I am chair, and it is as chair that I am asking this question, in relation to which the political groups have reached agreement by consensus. I am pleased to be asking this question, which has had the approval of the political group coordinators on my committee and which seeks a response from the European Commission on a range of concerns regarding the state of play of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations, which have been ongoing since 2007

then you shall enquire, and make search, and ask diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination was done amongst you,

The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel.
When a prophet speaks in the LORD’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.

When a man takes a wife and marries her, then it shall be, if she finds no favour in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face. She shall answer and say, “So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.”

Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only,
Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil.

E Mosè disse ad Aaronne: “Prendi un vaso, mettivi dentro un intero omer di manna, e deponilo davanti all’Eterno, perché sia conservato per i vostri discendenti”.

Lo farai di tavole, vuoto; dovrà esser fatto, conforme ti è stato mostrato sul monte.
E v’incastonerai un fornimento di pietre: quattro ordini di pietre; nel primo ordine sarà un sardonio, un topazio e uno smeraldo;
Farai avvicinare Aaronne e i suoi figliuoli all’ingresso della tenda di convegno, e li laverai con acqua.
E se rimarrà della carne della consacrazione o del pane fino alla mattina dopo, brucerai quel resto col fuoco; non lo si mangerà, perché è cosa santa.

E l’Eterno disse a Mosè: “Farò anche questo che tu chiedi, poiché tu hai trovato grazia agli occhi miei, e ti conosco personalmente”.

Quand’un uomo o una donna avrà sulla pelle del suo corpo delle macchie lucide, delle macchie bianche,
Il settimo giorno si raderà tutti i peli, il capo, la barba, le ciglia: si raderà insomma tutti i peli, si laverà le vesti e si laverà il corpo nell’acqua, e sarà puro.
Il settimo giorno, il sacerdote vi tornerà; e se, esaminandola, vedrà che la piaga s’è allargata sulle pareti della casa,

E tutti i figliuoli d’Israele mormorarono contro Mosè e contro Aaronne, e tutta la raunanza disse loro: “Fossimo pur morti nel paese d’Egitto! o fossimo pur morti in questo deserto!
Ma quanto a voi, i vostri cadaveri cadranno in questo deserto.
L’Eterno parlò ancora a Mosè, dicendo:
Fate questo: prendete de’ turiboli, tu, Kore, e tutta la gente che è con te;

Il quindicesimo giorno del settimo mese avrete una santa convocazione; non farete alcuna opera servile, e celebrerete una festa in onor dell’Eterno per sette giorni.
Quand’uno avrà fatto un voto all’Eterno od avrà con giuramento contratta una solenne obbligazione, non violerà la sua parola, ma metterà in esecuzione tutto quello che gli è uscito di bocca.
Ecco, sono esse che, a suggestione di Balaam, trascinarono i figliuoli d’Israele alla infedeltà verso l’Eterno, nel fatto di Peor, onde la piaga scoppiò nella raunanza dell’Eterno.

ricordati delle grandi prove che vedesti con gli occhi tuoi, de’ miracoli e dei prodigi, della mano potente e del braccio steso coi quali l’Eterno, l’Iddio tuo, ti trasse dall’Egitto; così farà l’Eterno, l’Iddio tuo, a tutti i popoli, dei quali hai timore.
Sappi dunque oggi che l’Eterno, il tuo Dio, è quegli che marcerà alla tua testa, come un fuoco divorante; ei li distruggerà e li abbatterà davanti a te; tu li scaccerai e li farai perire in un attimo, come l’Eterno ti ha detto.

Ma passerete il Giordano e abiterete il paese che l’Eterno, il vostro Dio, vi dà in eredità, e avrete requie da tutti i vostri nemici che vi circondano e sarete stanziati in sicurtà;

Potrete mangiare d’ogni volatile puro.
E se l’animale ha qualche difetto, se è zoppo o cieco o ha qualche altro grave difetto, non lo sacrificherai all’Eterno, al tuo Dio;
Colui che dovrà morire sarà messo a morte sulla deposizione di due o di tre testimoni; non sarà messo a morte sulla deposizione di un solo testimonio.
Avrai così per l’appunto quello che chiedesti all’Eterno, al tuo Dio, in Horeb, il giorno della raunanza, quando dicesti: “Ch’io non oda più la voce dell’Eterno, dell’Iddio mio, e non vegga più questo gran fuoco, ond’io non muoia”.

Allo straniero potrai prestare a interesse, ma non al tuo fratello; affinché l’Eterno, il tuo Dio, ti benedica in tutto ciò a cui porrai mano, nel paese dove stai per entrare per prenderne possesso.

Maledetto chi accetta un donativo per condannare a morte un innocente! E tutto il popolo dirà: Amen.

Ele lavou nos um novo modo de viver, como resultado do Espírito Santo nos transformar no interior.
Eu, Paulo, estou escrevendo isto de próprio punho: Eu pagarei eu poderia mencionar para você que você me deve até mais que sua alma/você.
Aquelas coisas perecerão, mas você continuará vivendo .
E um profeta escreveu em outra passagem das Escrituras aquilo que Cristo tinha dito sobre Deus:
Portanto, percebemos (daquele exemplo que foi por não confiarem que não puderam entrar .
Você é um sacerdote eternamente, bem como Melquisedeque foi um sacerdote.
Agora esse Melquisedeque. Ele foi rei de Salém um sacerdote de Deus, aquele que é maior Ele se encontrou com Abraão, que voltava depois que tinham derrotado os reis [SYN]. Melquisedeque abençoasse Abraão.
sumos sacerdotes precisam sacrificar diariamente, Assim procedem, primeiro, seus próprios pecados, e depois  outras pessoas. ele não precisa fazer isso. A única coisa que foi sacrificar-se a si mesmo uma só vez!
Detrás da cortina, dentro do , havia outro salão, que se chamava “o lugar santíssimo”.
pois não há sangue de touros nem de bodes que possa tirar a culpa daqueles que pecaram.
Devemos continuar professando resolutamente fielmente ele prometeu , devemos esperar confiantes que
Foi por confiar em Deus que Abraão vivia como se fosse estrangeiro numa terra que lhe tinha prometido. Abraão morava em tendas, e seu filho Isaque e neto Jacó seguiram a mesma prática. Deus prometeu dar- lhes as mesmas coisas que prometera dar a Abraão.
Embora todas essas pessoas fossem elogiadas {elogiasse todas essas pessoas} por confiarem nele, Deus não lhes deu tudo que tinha prometido a elas
Cuidado para não recusarem escutar a voz , que lhes fala. Os israelitas não foram excluídos quando (OU, ) os advertiu aqui na terra. Portanto,— nós com certeza não seremos excluídos se o rejeitarmos quando ele nos advertir do céu!/ como escaparemos se o rejeitarmos quando ele nos advertir do céu?—[RHQ]
Por isso, peço a Deus que ele possa prover a vocês todas as boas coisas que possam fazer aquilo que ele deseja. Que ele possa realizar em nós as coisas que ele considera agradáveis como resultado de Jesus Cristo
Mas, ao se aqueles que olham minuciosamente a mensagem de Deus - que é perfeita/completa e que os liberta para se eles continuarem e não simplesmente a escutarem e depois se esquecerem, mas fizerem , Deus os abençoará por aquilo que eles fazem.
Meus companheiros cristãos, poucos de vocês deveriam desejar se tornar os que habitualmente ensinam vocês sabem julgará/examinará a nós (excl), os que ensinamos a outros, com maior cuidado do

Louvem a Deus, que é o Pai de nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo. Ele tem feito com que tenhamos um novo modo de viver [MET], porque teve grande pena de nós. Já que ele fez com que Jesus Cristo vivesse de novo depois de morrer, ele nos deu poder para viver confiantemente, esperando de todo coração receber as coisas que Deus prometeu dar para nós.
Vocês têm vindo ao Senhor Jesus. Ele é uma pedra [MET] vivo, (e) . Por um lado, ele foi rejeitado por pessoas {o rejeitaram}, mas Deus o escolheu e o considera sumamente valioso.
Quando foi insultado
Há muito tempo atrás, na época quando um grande barco estava sendo construído por Noé {quando Noé estava construindo um grande barco}, desobedeceram a Deus quando ele esperava com paciência [PRS] . Só umas poucas pessoas foram salvas {salvou só umas poucas pessoas} . Especificamente, Deus levou só oito pessoas pelas águas .
Humilhem-se, portanto, ao darem conta de que Deus tem grande poder [MTY] para punir os orgulhosos, para que possa honrar vocês no tempo determinado por ele.
[SIM]. até vocês [SYN] [MET] o dia amanhece e a estrela da manhã surge .
Elas dirão: “prometeram que Cristo voltará,  [RHQ] que ele voltará./? De fato, desde que os primeiros líderes cristãos morreram [EUP. As coisas desde que criou !”
A vocês, meus caros amigos, escrevo isto para lhes : Não pequem! Mas se qualquer de vocês por acaso pecar, temos Jesus Cristo, que é o Justo, fala ao Pai em nosso benefício.
para podermos ter confiança de quando voltar. Então não iremos nos envergonhar na presença de Cristo quando ele vier.
Agora mesmo esses indivíduos já estão entre nós!
É isto que diz: “Prometi que você viverá para sempre!” Nós viveremos para sempre se temos um íntimo relacionamento com seu Filho/o homem que é também Deus.
Alguns deles relataram à congregação você os ama. Você deve continuar ajudando tais pessoas nas suas viagens, de uma forma que seja do agrado de Deus.
Eles lhes disseram, “Nos últimos tempos haverá pessoas que se zombarão Elas praticarão as coisas ímpias que o delas deseja”.
também que vocês continuam com perseverança. vocês continuaram servindo-porque em mim e não se cansaram

“Eu, advirto a todos aqueles que ouvem as palavras relativas àquilo que já predisse neste livro, Se alguém acrescentar qualquer coisa a estas palavras, Deus vai fazê-lo sofrer as pragas que são descritas {que descrevi} neste livro.
"A Comissão recorda o seu compromisso em velar por que os Estados-Membros estabeleçam quadros de concordância, que liguem as medidas de transposição por eles adoptadas com a directiva da UE, e os comuniquem à Comissão, no contexto da transposição da legislação da UE, no interesse dos cidadãos, de uma melhor legislação e de uma maior transparência jurídica, e a fim de ajudar no exame da conformidade das normas nacionais com as disposições da UE.
A Assembleia Euronest, criada recentemente, deveria constituir um instrumento de intercâmbio e de cooperação. No caso da Bielorrússia, é impossível cumprir plenamente este objectivo devido às medidas adoptadas. O resultado geral da decisão implica uma violação da Declaração de Praga e o abrandamento de uma possível evolução positiva em matéria de cooperação mútua.
A Comissão continuará também a promover o desenvolvimento sustentável, o trabalho digno, normas laborais e a responsabilidade social das empresas em outros domínios, tal como a política de comércio e desenvolvimento.
A Comissão tem uma opinião sobre a importância que se deve atribuir ao papel dos agricultores no que diz respeito a sumidouros de carbono, florestas e outras medidas, no combate a um dos maiores desafios de hoje que se coloca ao nosso meio ambiente?
A Europa partilha de alguma responsabilidade, pelo facto de a questão da segurança nuclear não ser uma questão de soberania nacional, mas sim uma questão de responsabilidade europeia.
A República da Croácia requereu a sua participação nas actividades do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT), criado em 1993 e com sede em Lisboa.
A União Europeia carece de novas sinergias e de uma abordagem integrada entre as diferentes políticas sectoriais, a fim de se alcançar o melhor resultado para o crescimento e o desenvolvimento no terreno. É necessário um maior empenho em prol de uma política regional cada vez mais flexível e integrada com outros instrumentos e programas.
A actual ausência de normas harmonizadas relativas à marcação de origem coloca a União Europeia em desvantagem, priva os produtores europeus de bens de consumo cuja origem é um critério importante da oportunidade de tirarem os benefícios associados à produção na União, e impede os consumidores de terem acesso à informação relativa à origem dos produtos. A marcação de origem facilitaria a escolha do consumidor e contribuiria para reduzir as marcas de origem fraudulentas, imprecisas e enganosas.
A aprovação de uma Convenção da OIT sobre trabalhadores domésticos constituiria uma primeira medida no sentido de colmatar a lacuna existente, ao garantir direitos associados à sua contratação, a aumentos salariais, à adopção de critérios pelos empregadores ou até ao esclarecer que os empregados domésticos não têm necessariamente de residir em casa do empregador.
A concluir, no que respeita ao relatório sobre as dimensões culturais das acções externas da UE, quero salientar a importância da cultura nas nossas políticas de cooperação. É essencial melhorar o entendimento mútuo com países terceiros e, num período de grande agitação política a Sul das nossas fronteiras, parece-me que faz muito sentido encontrarmos resposta para as questões em causa.
A crise financeira e económica projectou uma luz crítica sobre as agências de notação de crédito e, em particular, sobre o seu papel activo no prolongamento da crise, e os principais problemas identificados são a falta de concorrência, a dependência excessiva das agências de notação externas e a falta de responsabilização no sector.
A directiva em questão aplica-se às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e o seu objectivo é uma alteração quantitativa da Directiva 2000/25/CE. A directiva em apreço diz respeito às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e propõe uma alteração meramente quantitativa à Directiva 2000/25/CE. Esta directiva é urgente pelo facto de incidir num período que já teve início no dia 1 de Janeiro de 2011 e, aspecto muito importante, pelas repercussões positivas que se espera venha a ter no sector em questão. A presente directiva estabelece o nível máximo de emissões para cada tipo de tractor, em função da potência do motor utilizado, e organiza a redução progressiva das emissões em etapas sucessivas.
A este respeito, estou cada vez mais preocupado com a questão das exclusões. Compreendo perfeitamente que a Índia exija certas exclusões em certos sectores das negociações. Um país com o nível de desenvolvimento que a Índia hoje apresenta precisa de exclusões. Trata-se de uma questão que, certamente, nós, na Europa, bem podemos entender.
A finalidade deste relatório relativo à instituição de um instrumento de financiamento da cooperação para o desenvolvimento é definir, numa fase inicial, uma posição do Parlamento nesta matéria.
A inclusão de novos indicadores e o estabelecimento de limiares inferiores e superiores dos mesmos, que serão simétricos quando necessário, permitirão funcionar como níveis de alerta, para evitar os resgates financeiros actuais, levados a cabo pela Comissão e pelo FMI.
A legislação que neste caso é revogada diz respeito às condições de aceitação das provas de origem de certos produtos têxteis com origem em países terceiros, que estabelecia requisitos específicos através da aplicação de restrições quantitativas. O relator subscreve a opinião da Comissão de que as medidas de política comercial aplicadas pela União no sector dos têxteis podem ser geridas sem que seja imposto o encargo excessivo da apresentação da prova de origem para todas as importações. Em nossa opinião, é do interesse dos consumidores e das empresas assegurar que qualquer encargo imposto aos importadores de mercadorias de países terceiros sirva para controlar e limitar esses bens.
A minha solução para este problema é, portanto, a seguinte: coloque-se a ênfase na ajuda directa à reconstrução na sequência das inundações e tomem-se medidas imediatas em vez de se perderem em negociações em Genebra.
A palavra mais importante em qualquer debate deste tema é a "ponderação". Os antibióticos não são prejudiciais, mas a sua utilização imprudente e desregrada é perigosa. Não se pode condenar os antibióticos, mas devem ser utilizados com ponderação em humanos e animais.
A política europeia de coesão é e continuará a ser uma pedra angular da actividade tangível da UE nas suas regiões, assim como a principal fonte de investimento na economia real, capaz de ajudar a Europa e as suas regiões a recuperar da crise e a ganhar de novo competitividade. O Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional e os outros Fundos Estruturais já fizeram muito mas podem e devem fazer mais e melhor pela União Europeia. É neste espírito que concordo com o conteúdo e a estrutura do relatório do senhor deputado Stavrakakis, ao qual dou o meu apoio.
A presença de materiais derivados de animais deve ser claramente indicada, de modo a evitar que os consumidores ou pessoas que sofram de alergias corram o risco de comprar inadvertidamente produtos em pele verdadeira quando prefeririam não o fazer.
A propósito, Senhor Presidente, durante estas questões, houve um elemento específico que surgiu, nomeadamente que cada Mandado de Detenção custa 25 000 euros ao Tesouro Público.
A realidade dos últimos anos tem demonstrado à saciedade a falta de credibilidade das agências de notação de crédito.
A resolução parlamentar aprovada hoje envia um sinal a forte todos os Estados-Membros para que assinem esta convenção, que tem poderes, espero sinceramente, para reforçar a inclusão social dos trabalhadores, concedendo-lhes acesso aos direitos sociais normais que assistem a todos os trabalhadores.
A senhora deputada Wallis assevera que o Parlamento Europeu aplica sempre os mesmos princípios em relação ao levantamento da imunidade dos seus membros, o que é uma mentira cínica.
A velocidade e o âmbito da nossa integração com a Ucrânia, e vice-versa, irão depender do facto de a Ucrânia poder ou não garantir plenamente que respeita os direitos humanos, os princípios da democracia e os princípios do Estado de direito.
Abstenho-me por consideração para com os trabalhadores belgas da fábrica da Opel em Antuérpia, que foram sacrificados em nome da sacrossanta globalização. Tendo em conta a situação a que as políticas neoliberais defendidas pela União Europeia os conduziram, poderíamos votar contra o montante irrisório que as elites europeias lhes atribuem.
Acolhi favoravelmente este relatório, uma vez que as avaliações de impacto (AI) são um instrumento central do processo legislativo de que a autoridade legislativa europeia se deve servir mais intensivamente no futuro.
Acredito no impacto positivo que o seu desenvolvimento poderá ter tanto a nível económico (em termos de criação de emprego e de contribuição para o PIB) como a nível social (sob a forma de integração social e cultural dos cidadãos). Desta forma, louvo o apoio visado para o sector da criação, pois penso ser este o caminho certo para um crescimento duradouro e sustentável da economia europeia, face à conjuntura mundial apresentada nos nossos dias. A inovação, a coesão estrutural e a criação de novos produtos e serviços devem ser uma prioridade tida em conta na construção de qualquer política europeia.
Actualmente, a Europa está a ficar para trás, enquanto os EUA e a China estão a libertar grandes partes do espectro, a fim de permitir o rápido desenvolvimento de novos serviços e da Internet móvel de alta velocidade. O nosso objectivo deve ser fazer o que é melhor para a Europa: libertar o espectro para novos serviços e maior tráfego móvel, abrir novas oportunidades para cultura e conteúdo, para organismos de radiodifusão e serviços públicos no quadro da banda larga e, ao mesmo tempo, assegurar aos organismos de radiodifusão as mesmas oportunidades de que gozam hoje. A banda larga sem fios é essencial para garantir que serviços novos e inovadores estejam disponíveis para todos os cidadãos. Parece óbvio que este objectivo não pode ser alcançado através da utilização da fibra óptica, cuja instalação requer um investimento considerável, mas através da utilização de uma mistura de tecnologias sem fios disponíveis para alargar a cobertura por banda larga (radiocomunicações terrestres, cabo, fibra ou sistemas de satélite) para cobrir todo o território da Comunidade, incluindo zonas rurais e periféricas, permitindo ao mercado escolher a tecnologia mais eficiente do ponto de vista do custo para operadores e cidadãos.
Adicionalmente a estas diferenças ao nível do direito dos contratos, há também outros obstáculos que impedem as transacções transfronteiriças, e que têm a ver com domínios como questões fiscais, propriedade intelectual ou a disponibilidade de métodos de pagamento electrónico.
Agora que o Serviço Europeu de Acção Externa está a pôr em prática as suas regras de acesso à informação e aos documentos, sugeria-lhe que fizesse dele uma organização moderna, acessível aos cidadãos e que não veja a política externa como um domínio exclusivo de alguns diplomatas norteados pelo secretismo.
Agravar os custos a assumir pelo sector significa aumentar a carga a suportar pela sociedade no seu todo e penalizar as nossas mercadorias, o que terá como consequência uma quebra na procura.
Al-Nashiri esteve encarecrado na Polónia, numa prisão secreta criada pela CIA, onde foi sujeito a intensa tortura. Nós, Europeus, temos finalmente de aceitar com seriedade a nossa quota-parte de responsabilidade por estas violações dos direitos humanos. A prática de silenciar os factos, varrendo-os para debaixo do tapete e permitindo que os responsáveis permaneçam impunes, não deve continuar. O debate de hoje mostra que não é útil falar em termos superficiais acerca de sentimentos anti-americanos ou anti-europeus.
Alguns deputados avançaram a ideia de que nos devemos concentrar nos acordos multilaterais e não nos bilaterais. É o que fazemos! Como é do vosso conhecimento, as negociações multilaterais da Ronda de Doha encontram-se em grandes dificuldades e nós somos o único grande bloco comercial que fez recentemente propostas para tentar ultrapassar as diferenças entre as economias desenvolvidas e emergentes no tocante aos sectores industriais.
Além disso, a Comissão está a colaborar estreitamente com os Estados-Membros e com as Presidências da UE em prol do desenvolvimento de indicadores para o seguimento, a nível da UE, das 12 áreas da chamada Plataforma de Acção de Pequim.
Além disso, apresenta propostas válidas a fim de que as verbas ainda por atribuir possam dar um contributo real para o aumento da competitividade e da qualidade no mercado europeu.
Além disso, em resultado da severa política de austeridade que vigora em muitos países, é praticamente impossível os jovens conseguirem um emprego condigno quando terminam a sua formação. Actualmente, apenas um quarto dos jovens na Irlanda estão empregados e todas as semanas 1 000 pessoas emigram, por isso, para muitas famílias irlandesas, a expressão "Juventude em Movimento” tem um significado muito diferente. A presente crise de emprego só poderá ser resolvida com um grande esforço de investimento público, com vista a criar postos de trabalho condignos.
Além disso, não obstante os progressos feitos nos últimos anos, a participação das pequenas e médias empresas no Programa-Quadro deve ser reforçada, a fim de desenvolver as competências que lhes permitam aumentar a sua competitividade.
Além disso, o senhor prometeu que, quando avaliar a auditoria de desempenho, estabelecerá padrões claros; trata-se, de qualquer forma, de uma obrigação que lhe cabe no âmbito do Tratado de Lisboa.
Além disso, também em termos económicos, a livre circulação é crucial para o sucesso do mercado único e dos esforços continuados da Europa no sentido de estimular o crescimento e o emprego.
Ambos os projectos têm problemas semelhantes.
Ao apoiarmos o compromisso alcançado entre o Parlamento e o Conselho, estamos a pôr fim a um processo de longos anos de negociação. Este é sem dúvida um passo na direcção certa, mas é um acordo minimalista que carece de ambição! Com efeito, os Estados-Membros terão apenas a possibilidade de, mas não serão de modo algum obrigados a, fazer com que os veículos pesados paguem os custos externos que geram. A verdade é que a ideia foi agora lançada, e é aí que reside o ponto verdadeiramente positivo que me permite votar a favor do compromisso.
Ao introduzir um direito europeu dos contratos e ao tornar a escolha da legislação nacional ou europeia facultativa para as empresas, confunde o sistema e irá gerar sobreposições jurídicas que podem resultar em tribunais onerosos. É igualmente provável que direito europeu dos contratos favoreça as políticas sociais e de emprego da UE, nomeadamente a directiva relativa ao tempo de trabalho, que se revelou muito impopular e causou perturbações no Reino Unido a várias empresas e serviços essenciais.
Ao mesmo tempo, gostaria de sublinhar que a UE deve adoptar uma atitude de contenção e atribuir estes recursos por meio de uma redistribuição efectuada no âmbito do orçamento europeu existente.
Ao relatar o nível de exposição à dívida soberana, os intervenientes no Mercado poderão fazer a sua própria avaliação do risco.
Apenas 10 Estados-Membros forneceram informações, o que é muito pouco.
Apesar de preservar a estrutura original do Objectivo 3, o relatório propõe um aumento dos fundos e chama a atenção para as necessidades específicas das populações de fronteira. É possível garantir uma abordagem estratégica e uma resposta orientada para as necessidades e as especificidades de cada região através de uma afectação de fundos aos programas de cooperação territorial, decidida com base em critérios harmonizados.
Aplicámos sanções à Bielorrússia, mas não fizemos o mesmos relativamente ao caso Magnitski na Rússia, embora este tivesse sido mencionado pelo Parlamento Europeu no Relatório Anual sobre Direitos Humanos no Mundo de 2009 e na política da União Europeia sobre esta matéria.
Apoiei o relatório sobre a proposta de decisão do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho que estabelece o primeiro programa do espectro radioeléctrico.
Apoio fervorosamente a inclusão da vertente cultural no projecto de organigrama do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE). É igualmente importante proporcionar formação adequada ao pessoal do SEAE sobre os aspectos culturais e digitais. A cultura também é um factor importante na luta pelos direitos humanos e no apoio à democracia.
Apoiámos esta resolução e apresentámos uma pergunta à Comissão, pois consideramos que a mesma é fundamental neste momento em que os preços do petróleo têm vindo a atingir desde alguns meses os níveis mais elevados de sempre.
Aprova-se o relatório em apreço, tendo em conta que, com as necessárias negociações, o relator teve a oportunidade de assegurar a inclusão de uma cláusula de revisão para o regulamento referido para possível introdução, após um relatório de implementação pela Comissão, de novos modelos que cobrem uma variedade de bens ambientais.
Aprovo este relatório, porque a cultura pode ser um elemento crucial para as relações internacionais ao contribuir para o desenvolvimento, inclusão, democracia e prevenção de conflitos e por tal razão deve ser incluída na evolução do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa.
Após semanas de negociações, foi finalmente alcançado um acordo sobre esta questão crucial para os cidadãos europeus, ou seja, os direitos dos consumidores.
As PME continuam a esbarrar com graves dificuldades para expandirem as suas actividades e, por vezes, até mesmo para sobreviverem. É, portanto, necessário reduzir a burocracia através do reforço do controlo e de uma regulamentação inteligente.
As autoridades búlgaras enviaram toda a documentação necessária aos seus homólogos romenos, atestando que o navio se encontra inscrito no registo da União Europeia e está na posse de todas as licenças para pescar nas águas do Mar Negro. Não obstante, não houve qualquer progresso por parte da Roménia. A única resposta foi que apenas a legislação romena e a Constituição do país são aplicáveis.
As conclusões aprovadas pelo Conselho "Justiça e Assuntos Internos", em 11 e 12 de Abril de 2011, e a comunicação emitida pela Comissão a semana passada são passos importantes nesse sentido. A Presidência convocou uma reunião extraordinária do Conselho "Justiça e Assuntos Internos" para 12 de Maio, a fim de debater a questão da gestão dos fluxos migratórios e de refugiados.
As directivas dizem respeito às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e dos motores de máquinas móveis não rodoviárias.
As florestas e demais zonas arborizadas abrangem mais de 42% da superfície da UE, representando um meio de subsistência para milhões de trabalhadores. A conservação do património florestal representa um contributo importante para o bem-estar das populações e a criação de emprego nas zonas rurais, devendo ser indissociável da prevenção de incêndios florestais, catástrofe que dizima extensas áreas de floresta anualmente, no Sul da Europa e nomeadamente em Portugal.
As instituições europeias são igualmente responsáveis pelo cumprimento destes princípios pelos Estados-Membros após a adesão. Gostaria de lembrar-vos desta responsabilidade e, em particular, ao Presidente da Comissão e à Senhora Comissária, que são os principais responsáveis neste âmbito. O conteúdo da nova Constituição húngara e as circunstâncias da sua redacção não respeitam estes princípios fundamentais.
As negociações com o Japão, tendo em vista aprofundar relações comerciais, não podem ser utilizadas como um instrumento de classe ao serviço dos grandes grupos económicos e financeiros, promovendo uma crescente exploração dos trabalhadores e dos povos, a destruição das forças produtivas e a destruição do ambiente.
As outras faixas deveriam ser libertadas até 1 de Janeiro de 2012, como estipulado na proposta da Comissão. Na minha opinião, deveríamos fazer pressão no sentido da atribuição de mais frequências para os serviços móveis, com uma meta mínima de 1 200 MHz. É essencial introduzir normas razoáveis que possibilitem a libertação de mais faixas do espectro no futuro.
As prioridades e objectivos políticos definidos são promover o emprego, reforçar a inovação, a investigação e o crescimento, abordar as alterações climáticas, melhorar os níveis de educação, alcançar a integração social e combater a pobreza, complementando políticas em matérias de imigração, e salvaguardar recursos para desenvolver zonas inacessíveis e fronteiriças.
As redes mantêm-se diariamente em contacto entre si e permitem o intercâmbio atempado de informações, criando assim as bases para uma rápida intervenção. A Comissão realiza quase diariamente reuniões com as autoridades dos Estados-Membros nos domínios da saúde pública e da segurança alimentar, a fim de discutir a evolução da situação epidemiológica, as medidas sanitárias tomadas para impedir a infecção e o tratamento a dar às pessoas contaminadas. O Sistema de Alerta Rápido e Resposta e o Sistema de Alerta Rápido para Alimentos para Consumo Humano e Animal (RASFF) revelaram ser uma base sólida para o intercâmbio de informações.
As unidades de medida são indispensáveis para qualquer instrumento de medição, para a expressão de qualquer medição efectuada e para a expressão de qualquer indicação de grandeza.
Assim sendo, é uma boa oportunidade para acrescentarmos melhorias ao acordo agora existente.
Assim, do que precisamos é de abertura às reformas e de coragem política.
Assim, pergunto à Comissão que medidas tenciona tomar em defesa do mercado hortofrutícola e que novas medidas tenciona igualmente tomar para evitar a divulgação de informações pouco fiáveis acerca das origens da bactéria EHEC, que está a prejudicar todo o sector hortofrutícola e a lançar o pânico entre as populações. Estamos a falar de alimentos de qualidade!
Assumindo aqui, na qualidade de um Comissário, uma responsabilidade que não tem, deveria ter dito: "Senhora deputada Rebecca Harms, Senhores Deputados ao Parlamento Europeu, assumi uma enorme tarefa, mas consegui apenas realizar escassos progressos". Deveria ter referido o facto de existirem grandes problemas, de os testes de stress serem puramente voluntários, de só estarem a ser realizados no papel e de, em grande medida, estarem nas mãos dos operadores, que é onde sempre estiveram.
Atribuímos grande importância à superação da actual crise política e dos seus efeitos económicos e sociais para a população de Madagáscar, que estão a aumentar o fardo que esta tem de suportar todos os dias.
Avistei-me ontem com o Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Síria. O que está a acontecer na Síria é uma aspiração popular pela democracia e pelo Estado de direito - não é uma ingerência estrangeira.
Caros Colegas, como podem verificar, estamos a assistir a uma discussão fundamental sobre o futuro da Europa e aguardamos a posição da Comissão.
Chegámos a um compromisso na Comissão do Desenvolvimento Regional e eu aconselho esta Assembleia a incorporar o compromisso alcançado pelos políticos especializados no relatório Garriga.
Com a preparação de todo o debate, fiquei em contacto, evidentemente, com alguns ministros de certos Estados-Membros especialmente confrontados com esses aspectos dos países vizinhos.
Com efeito, o panorama completo do período de programação de 2007-2013 apenas será visível em 2015, dois anos após o segundo relatório estratégico, já que certos países têm mais dois anos para utilizar todo o financiamento atribuído. Votei favoravelmente o presente relatório que alerta entre outras coisas para o facto de, em certas áreas, a selecção e a implementação efectivas dos projectos ter condicionantes que urge combater.
Com isto "Considerando que o Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão concluiu, no seu parecer, que a proposta em apreço se cinge à codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem alterações substantivas, o PE aprova a sua posição em primeira leitura, fazendo sua a proposta da Comissão, na redacção resultante da adaptação às recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão".
Com vista à salvaguarda dos diferentes interesses, a Comissão deverá aconselhar-se junto de cada Estado-Membro, bem como dos membros e dos representantes dos respectivos organismos de avaliação, a fim de garantir que as diferentes necessidades específicas não ficam subordinadas aos interesses comunitários.
Como discordam aliás os milhões de trabalhadores, de agricultores, de pequenos e médios empresários e muitos outros que, por todo o mundo, ao longo dos anos, vêm apontando o dedo acusador à OMC, aos seus objectivos de desregulação do comércio e aos interesses que serve: o das transnacionais e o dos grandes grupos económicos e financeiros, que arrecadam milhões à custa do sacrifício de milhões de postos de trabalho, de direitos laborais e sociais, da destruição da pequena e média produção e da degradação ambiental.
Como muitas pessoas, pensava que se tratava, basicamente, de um serviço de babysitting, mas agora sei que a educação na primeira infância é o melhor investimento e proporciona o melhor retorno possível do investimento na educação a qualquer nível.
Como recordamos dos protestos pós-eleitorais de Dezembro do ano passado, Lukashenko não tolera a dissidência e aparentemente tem gosto em recorrer à violência e à intimidação contra activistas pró-democracia.
Como se pode constatar pelas margens dos títulos de dívida, a Espanha está a dissociar-se desses países, graças a uma acção determinada nas frentes orçamental, financeira e estrutural.
Como é óbvio, há que incentivar a inovação, mas tal não deverá ser feito em detrimento de outras políticas fundamentais para o futuro da União Europeia, como é o caso da Política Agrícola Comum. A PAC deve ser reformulada apostando em alguns objectivos fundamentais, mas sem espoliar a única política integrada da União Europeia.
Concordo com a focalização dada pelo relator a dois vectores muito importantes para a investigação europeia futura, sendo estes uma maior simplificação nos pagamentos entre a Comissão Europeia e outras entidades e uma acrescida participação das PME e da indústria em geral na resposta aos grandes desafios sociais.
Concordo com todos os argumentos do relatório: é importante que os Estados-Membros e a União arquem com a responsabilidade por medidas destinadas a apoiar a aprendizagem na primeira infância, mas devem assumir um papel que não pode ser atribuído apenas aos pais ou aos profissionais do sector da educação. Como defendo sempre nas reuniões da Comissão dos Direitos da Mulher e da Igualdade dos Géneros, pais que vivem na pobreza significam filhos criados na pobreza.
Concordo, pois, com as recomendações do relator no sentido da elaboração de um planeamento financeiro exaustivo e integrado de modo a que os fundos sejam aplicados em projectos que visem a concretização dos objectivos estabelecidos na Estratégia UE 2020 e não em acções que se limitam a consumir esses mesmos fundos.
Congratulo-me com a adopção da Resolução do Parlamento Europeu sobre a Análise do "Small Business Act”, que adapta as medidas de apoio da UE às pequenas e médias empresas (PME) ao novo contexto resultante da crise económica de 2008 e assegura que tais medidas são suficientes para o cumprimento das metas da estratégia "Europa 2020”. As PME foram as primeiras a ser afectadas pela crise financeira e bancária que se tem vindo a fazer sentir ao longo destes últimos anos e que reduziu o acesso destas empresas ao financiamento e aos mercados.
Congratulo-me com o facto de o documento em apreço não pensar a inclusão dos jovens apenas na perspectiva do emprego, mas também pelo prisma da educação e da formação. A este respeito, gostaria de salientar a solicitação à Comissão Europeia, que apoio, de que apresente um Livro Verde sobre a Participação dos jovens.
Congratulo-me também com o facto de a Comissão - como nos informou oficiosamente - estar a trabalhar na preparação de uma nova proposta a um ritmo acelerado, esforçando-se por manter na nova proposta legislativa o maior número possível de elementos do acordo preliminar obtido nas últimas negociações. A Presidência garante o seu apoio à Comissão e ao Parlamento e espera que surja muito em breve uma oportunidade de aprovar esta nova proposta.
Consequentemente, já não há qualquer motivo para não poderem integrar esta zona de livre circulação. Eu consideraria inaceitável que certos Estados, utilizando pretextos falsos e motivados por cálculos de política interna, se continuassem a opor a essa integração. O acervo da União não deve ser encarado como um sistema à la carte em que os Estados-Membros podem adaptar ou suspender disposições em função das circunstâncias.
Consideramos que é importante verificar a fiabilidade e a comparabilidade dos dados para se poder proceder a algumas melhorias e garantir um elevado nível de qualidade da contabilidade ambiental. Há que ter igualmente em linha de conta o desenvolvimento de novos módulos e a experiência adquirida no decorrer de estudos-piloto. O relatório de revisão deve ser encarado como uma oportunidade de ajustar o regulamento à luz dos últimos progressos conseguidos e das experiências amadurecidas.
Considero fundamental que as verbas da política de coesão sejam, pelo menos, mantidas nos mesmos montantes.
Considero que as actividades das agências de notação de crédito são na generalidade extremamente dúbias. Não apenas por não identificarem os riscos tempestivamente, como no caso do mercado imobiliário dos Estados Unidos, mas também porque podem piorar uma situação já de si má após a ocorrência de uma crise. Não podemos permitir que agências de notação privadas dos EUA decidam arbitrariamente a solvabilidade dos Estados europeus. O relatório em apreço é um passo no sentido certo com vista à existência de controlos mais rigorosos das agências de notação de crédito, razão pela qual votei a favor.
Considero que o relatório sublinha os aspectos críticos do Sétimo Programa-Quadro.
Considero, porém, que algumas das medidas incluídas nessa estratégia poderiam ser, talvez, alargadas à Mongólia, tendo em conta a sua história cultural, que é semelhante à dos outros países. O país possui, actualmente, o estatuto de observador na Organização para a Segurança e a Cooperação na Europa, e a União Europeia está a analisar a possibilidade de o ajudar a tornar-se um membro de pleno direito, atendendo aos laços culturais antigos que existem entre a Europa e a Mongólia.
Contribuir para mitigar as consequências das catástrofes deverá constituir um elemento importante da política externa da UE. Estas acções não devem estar associadas ao envio de forças militares. O envio de forças policiais deverá acontecer apenas em casos extremos, com base numa resolução da ONU, e com o objectivo de proteger os trabalhadores nos sectores da saúde, social e de serviços públicos, bem como para formar a polícia. A Política Externa e de Segurança Comum deve ser rigorosamente separada da NATO.
Contudo, as universidades devem manter a independência e o carácter público e os seus cursos devem conservar a sua orientação académica, assente na investigação. O ensino superior na União Europeia não deve limitar-se a reproduzir os modelos que criaram a crise e a perda de confiança. Pelo contrário, deve ter como objectivo criar novos padrões de coesão social e reforçar o carácter colectivo que os valores humanitários e um sistema europeu de classificação das universidades neles baseado possam desenvolver na direcção certa.
Contudo, há ainda alguns pontos que é preciso tomar em consideração e discutir. O acordo deve ter como objectivo, evidentemente, a concorrência leal, que só pode ser alcançada se forem removidas as barreiras tarifárias, não tarifárias e técnicas ao comércio. O princípio da reciprocidade tem de ser respeitado por ser essa a única forma de chegar a um resultado equilibrado nas negociações. O mesmo princípio aplica-se a aspectos específicos do país ou da cultura de cada um dos parceiros.
Contudo, os progressos variam consideravelmente entre países e entre temas, com taxas de selecção agregadas a cerca de 40% no caso de nove Estados-Membros e inferiores a 20% em quatro Estados-Membros. É óbvio que ainda existem disparidades económicas, sociais e ambientais flagrantes entre as regiões europeias.
Contudo, um orçamento virado para o futuro implica também uma mudança de prioridades e ainda mais fundos europeus. A terceira prioridade diz respeito aos recursos próprios da UE. Quando tornarmos o sistema mais justo e mais transparente, poderemos falar sobre recursos próprios.
Creio que a União deve desempenhar um papel activo e de liderança na reforma da governança global de modo a tornar as instituições e organizações internacionais e organizações mais legítimas, eficazes e propícias à responsabilidade compartilhada.
Creio ser necessário, como salientou a senhora deputada Ţicău, reservar fundos adicionais para o programa Galileo e, possivelmente, criar no orçamento da UE um fundo de reserva para o Galileo que cubra eventuais despesas adicionais, sem prejudicar, no entanto, os outros programas.
Da fronteira lituana vai ser possível avistar as chaminés de uma destas centrais nucleares com a mesma nitidez como podemos ver a torre da Catedral de Estrasburgo a partir do Parlamento.
Dado que os contratos públicos representam 17% do PIB da União Europeia, pensamos que as PME precisam de aumentar a sua participação no mercado dos contratos públicos. É por isso que solicitamos à Comissão e aos Estados-Membros que tomem as medidas necessárias até 2015 para garantir que pelo menos 50% das transacções de contratos públicos se realizem por via electrónica, em consonância com o compromisso assumido pelos governos dos Estados-Membros em Manchester, em 2005.
De acordo com a Comissão, a candidatura cumpre os requisitos de elegibilidade para beneficiar do Fundo e aquela instituição recomenda que a autoridade orçamental aprove a sua mobilização. Cumprirá apurar cabal e rapidamente a sua mobilização de modo a não fazer esperar os trabalhadores que devem efectivamente beneficiar do fundo.
De facto, acredito que o primeiro passo a dar na prevenção de futuras crises económicas é analisar com rigor os factores de risco que podem conduzir a desequilíbrios orçamentais, e o relatório aborda devidamente esta questão. Além do mais, estes critérios são comuns e quantificáveis, pelo que podem ser avaliados e comparados uniformemente em toda a Europa.
De igual modo, os projectos financiados no âmbito do programa temático para a migração e o asilo contam geralmente como APD.
Decidir sobre o cultivo de culturas geneticamente modificadas deve caber a cada um dos EstadosMembros. A proposta de que os agricultores que cultivam estas culturas não possam receber o pagamento único é totalmente desprovida de sentido. Há escassez de alimentos no mundo.
Deixámos margem de manobra, por exemplo, no que respeita ao tipo de participação pública, à educação e formação dos empregados e gestores, aos pormenores dos modelos financeiros - não à qualidade do financiamento -, e estamos a deixar em aberto, deliberadamente, a regulação das instalações de armazenagem definitiva construídas e/ou exploradas conjuntamente por vários EstadosMembros.
Desaponta-nos o facto de, na verdade, não haver nesta resolução uma proposta concreta para o cancelamento da dívida e para uma análise das dívidas externas.
Desejo desde já felicitar o Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência pelo relevante trabalho que tem vindo a desenvolver no sentido de reduzir a quantidade de drogas e dos fenómenos a estas associados no espaço europeu.
Desta vez, a Polónia recorreu ao Mandado de Detenção Europeu. Há dez dias, o senhor Disselkoen foi enviado para a Polónia. O seu advogado afirma que o seu cliente foi detido numa prisão tão insalubre e sobrelotada como as instalações em que esteve detido em 1997.
Deve ser creditado à Comissária Reding o facto de ter tido a candura de afirmar que sim, que este mandado tem problemas e levanta dúvidas e que há testes de proporcionalidade que devem ser passados quando são emitidos os mandatos, os quais não devem ser aplicados automaticamente sem que sobre eles seja deitado um olhar mais demorado e discriminado de um juiz.
Devemos centrar-nos em medidas políticas que não impliquem mais encargos administrativos para os nossos agricultores, a fim de não dificultarmos ainda mais a sua vida.
Devemos recordar o papel importante que as florestas desempenham na prestação de serviços socioeconómicos, assim como o seu contributo fundamental para o combate às alterações climáticas.
Deveria significar romper com centenas de regras.
Devo assinalar, contudo, que temos de identificar formas melhores de utilizar as receitas, obrigando a que os Estados-Membros invistam estes recursos na melhoria da Rede Transeuropeia de Transportes (RTE-T) e das infra-estruturas para reduzir a poluição. Essa é a única maneira de, no futuro, podermos dizer que a decisão de hoje teve resultados positivos.
Digo isto porque somos contra todas e quaisquer violações dos direitos humanos fundamentais, sempre e onde quer que elas ocorram.
Diz-se também muitas vezes que devemos aceitar migrantes políticos, mas fechar as portas da Europa aos migrantes económicos.
Durante as negociações sobre o pacote mais alargado de propostas legislativas, o "pacote de seis medidas”, foram feitas sugestões de melhoria desta directiva do Conselho, muitas delas pelo Banco Central Europeu e por membros desta Assembleia. O Conselho procurou de boa-fé, e sempre que adequado, melhorar a directiva, bem como melhorar a transparência, mantendo embora uma atitude cautelosa em relação a questões sensíveis relacionadas com as constituições nacionais.
E, por isso, o que se impunha era que a Comissão Europeia tivesse uma posição firme para alterar esta situação para por fim a paraísos fiscais, para controlar os mercados financeiros, para por fim ao agravamento das desigualdades e da exploração.
Elas necessitarão também de orçamentos próprios adicionais no próximo exercício.
Em 1998, a União Europeia definiu a obrigatoriedade de as empresas importadoras efectuarem uma prova de origem dos produtos que constam da Secção XI da Nomenclatura Combinada, referidos no Anexo 1 ao Regulamento (CEE) n.º 3030/93 do Conselho, e que tenham sido produzidos em países terceiros.
Em 25 de Março de 2011, o Conselho Europeu reiterou a importância estratégica da relação UE-Japão, afirmando que "Dever-se-á aproveitar a próxima cimeira para reforçar essa relação e fazer avançar a nossa agenda comum". A esse propósito, o Conselho salientou que as condições para um ACL bem sucedido devem ser analisadas com base no pressuposto de que o Japão esteja disposto a abordar, nomeadamente, a questão das barreiras não pautais e das restrições aos contratos públicos.
Em certa medida, as instituições de crédito têm prestado aquilo a que em direito francês se chama uma forma de apoio abusiva a uma estrutura sobreendividada. A sua conduta foi imprópria e causaram um prejuízo: têm, por isso, a obrigação de ressarcir.
Em especial, é preocupante o facto de este sistema de navegação por satélite ser encarado numa lógica de competição com o sistema GPS dos EUA, do qual depende a UE, o qual se encontra, como se sabe, sob o controlo militar, com financiamento militar dos programas federais norte-americanos.
Em média, a dívida na área do euro é inferior à do Reino Unido, para dar um exemplo.
Em primeira linha, é de salientar que estamos perante "o único domínio da acção externa (...) que não foi concebido para servir os interesses da UE, mas sim para defender os interesses das populações mais marginalizadas e vulneráveis do planeta”. Neste contexto, o Parlamento deve assumir uma posição de maior prevalência não só pela sua legitimação democrática (e plural), mas também pelos contributos que pode oferecer a nível material e procedimental.
Em primeiro lugar, estamos perante um relatório completo e abrangente que aborda de um modo construtivo as questões fundamentais levantadas pela avaliação intercalar do 7PQ. É muito encorajador ver que o relatório da avaliação intercalar suscitou respostas significativas das instituições e que estas respostas, embora pondo por vezes a tónica em questões diferentes, estão basicamente em conformidade com as conclusões e recomendações principais expressas pelos peritos da avaliação independente.
Em primeiro lugar, quero saudar o facto de haver uma estrutura de dois pilares, porque penso que isso é consensual.
Em relação ao Modo 4, impõe-se resolver os problemas relacionados com o reconhecimento das qualificações profissionais, questão que, todavia, é particularmente complexa, atendendo a que até mesmo entre os Estados-Membros da União Europeia temos problemas em matéria de reconhecimento mútuo das qualificações profissionais.
Em segundo lugar, a Grécia. A Grécia percorreu um longo caminho desde a situação extremamente difícil do ano passado e há que louvar os seus esforços. Viu-se confrontada com um desafio colossal e demonstrou um empenho inabalável e uma clareza de propósitos.
Em segundo lugar, importa dizer que também temos de investir parte do dinheiro.
Em segundo lugar, quero aflorar a questão do bloqueamento automático de fundos europeus sempre que se constata uma má gestão de dinheiro da UE ou quando existem indícios de que esse dinheiro teria sido mal gerido. É extremamente importante que intervenhamos rapidamente sempre que os mecanismos de gestão e execução dos fundos da UE não estejam a funcionar muito bem.
Em terceiro lugar, congratulo-me com a adopção da Estratégia da UE para a região do Danúbio pelo Conselho Europeu.
Em termos concretos, a capacidade das ICC para impulsionar a coesão social e territorial dependerá do investimento estratégico.
Em vez de nos debatermos por mais legislação em matéria de imigração e migração, devemos antes fazer com que a legislação já existente funcione mais e melhor a favor de todos os cidadãos da União. Ainda assim, as preocupações manifestadas pelos Estados-Membros não são reaccionárias, mas sim a consequência inevitável de mais de vinte anos de circunstâncias em permanente evolução na Europa e em todo o mundo.
Embora a Comissão tenha claramente afirmado que a directiva relativa à publicidade enganosa e comparativa proíbe as práticas enganosas destas empresas de directórios, impõe-se que a Comissão analise igualmente a questão da transposição dessa directiva pelos Estados-Membros, a fim de apurar se os cidadãos recebem igual protecção em toda a União. O facto de a directiva ter sido transposta pelos Estados-Membros não significa necessariamente que estas medidas sejam abrangentes ou estejam em conformidade umas com as outras.
Embora esteja relacionado com factores químicos e físicos que, à primeira vista, não são relevantes para a comunicação entre políticos e votantes, este indicador é, na realidade, o resultado de numerosas decisões económicas: indica a concentração de actividades económicas poluentes, a composição do cabaz energético utilizado para as actividades produtivas e para o aquecimento de casas e escritórios, a utilização de veículos motorizados e a gestão das infra-estruturas rodoviárias e do tráfego, o isolamento dos edifícios e a qualidade dos materiais utilizados, e ainda a existência ou não de zonas verdes, para dar apenas alguns exemplos. A qualidade do ar tem também um impacto significativo sobre as despesas com a saúde, particularmente no domínio das doenças respiratórias e oncológicas. É, pois, muito claro que um indicador ambiental pode transformar-se num indicador económico e político.
Embora o relatório seja ambicioso na procura do maior apoio maioritário possível da Assembleia, entendo que, na sua forma actual, lhe falta ambição nos objectivos e metas que procura realizar.
Embora, como refere a relatora, esteja prevista a entrada da Croácia na União Europeia no segundo semestre de 2012 ou no início de 2013, pode aceitar-se a sua participação no referido Observatório, dado que esse país está a fazer esforços em termos de investigação e repressão dos crimes relacionados com droga.
Enquanto estes últimos resumem a Europa ao montante das suas contribuições, que gostariam de ver diminuir, e ao seu retorno financeiro, que gostariam de ver aumentar, este relatório defende políticas europeias integradas fortes, quer se trate de políticas históricas ou das novas competências atribuídas pelo Tratado de Lisboa.
Entendo que a justificação para este facto é inteiramente política. O relatório também refere as inspecções realizadas na nossa fronteira com a Turquia, que cumpre os requisitos de Schengen e demonstra a nossa preparação. Espero sinceramente que este relatório seja aprovado na próxima sessão do Conselho Europeu porque quanto mais rapidamente actuarmos nesta questão, mais iremos ganhar - do ponto de vista político, económico e social.
Entre outras fontes de financiamento possíveis, o relatório propõe também que se considere a possibilidade de introduzir pagamentos por serviços ecossistémicos às empresas, através dos quais contribuem para a conservação da biodiversidade e a protecção das florestas. A par de diversas outras medidas, como o reforço da coordenação a nível da UE e do intercâmbio de informações entre os Estados-Membros, a Comissão é também exortada a considerar a apresentação de uma proposta legislativa que proíba a construção em terrenos desbravados por acção de incêndios comprovadamente resultantes de fogo posto.
Escolhi apenas dois exemplos específicos que demonstram que estamos a fazer progressos e que o problema está nos pormenores.
Espero dessa decisão de responsabilidade, essencialmente, que se perceba que as questões económicas e financeiras são cruciais e decisivas para a Europa, mas que as questões económicas e financeiras são instrumentais para aquela que é a finalidade principal da Europa, que é a finalidade de manter a paz.
Espero que o Conselho também chegue rapidamente a uma conclusão positiva em relação aos passos decisivos dados por este Parlamento para assegurar a rastreabilidade e a adequada informação sobre os produtos.
Espero, efectivamente, que o Parlamento chegue a um acordo final e aprove, o mais rapidamente possível, a totalidade do pacote em matéria de governação económica, de modo a transmitir uma mensagem forte e coesa para a opinião pública e a pôr fim à especulação.
Essa solução requer a participação das Nações Unidas, dos Estados Unidos e da União Europeia, e necessita do seu apoio activo para se conseguir a transferência de 3 400 refugiados do Campo de Ashraf para os Estados Unidos, o Canadá, a Austrália, a Noruega, a Suíça e Estados-Membros da UE, ou para outros locais onde tenham família ou outras ligações. Esta é a única opção que permite evitar uma nova catástrofe humanitária e mereceu a concordância dos próprios refugiados de Ashraf.
Esse é o desafio que aqui deixo e que aqui colocamos à Comissão Europeia, Senhor Comissário.
Esta atitude colide directamente com a Lei Fundamental da República Federal da Alemanha, segundo a qual "os cuidados prestados às crianças e a sua educação constituem um direito natural dos pais e um dever que é, em primeiro lugar, da sua responsabilidade” (artigo 6.º, n.º 2). Este relatório é uma manifestação da agenda anti-família da UE e procura interferir nas competências sociais dos Estados-Membros.
Esta grande abertura a possíveis modificações leva-me a expressar-me negativamente quanto às alterações que pretendem limitar tais deliberações futuras.
Esta opinião é dominante em todos os grupos do Parlamento Europeu, como atesta o facto de não terem sido apresentadas alterações ao relatório.
Esta revisão constitui igualmente um primeiro passo para o restabelecimento de uma concorrência leal entre os transportadores europeus, uma vez que alguns Estados-Membros, como França e a Alemanha, já aplicam o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" e pretendem vê-lo alargado a todos os outros.
Esta é a mensagem que o Presidente da Comissão Barroso, falando em nome da Comissão Europeia, envia há meses aos Estados-Membros.
Estamos a aguardar que a Comissão apresente um Livro Branco que reflicta esta abordagem global e coloque a ênfase na necessidade de assegurar um futuro para as nossas florestas e a preparação de todos nós para investir nesse futuro.
Estamos aqui a falar da confirmação, por parte dos ministros das finanças, de que os fundos da UE foram gastos correctamente nos seus países de origem.
Estamos preocupados, muitíssimo preocupados, porque a pior coisa que podia acontecer era que, no futuro próximo, realizássemos testes de stress e que tivéssemos o tipo de resultados que providenciassem a desculpa perfeita para muitos operadores de centrais nucleares obsoletas, incluindo as da zona onde vivo, manterem as centrais em actividade durante ainda mais tempo, em vez de as encerrarem.
Estas cedências comerciais, como reconhece o próprio relatório, irão prejudicar a indústria têxtil da União Europeia e os países e regiões dela mais dependentes.
Estas regras técnicas, respeitantes à aproximação das legislações dos Estados-Membros, permitem que o procedimento de homologação CE estabelecido pela Directiva 2003/37/CE seja aplicado relativamente a cada modelo de tractor.
Este ano assinala-se o 25.º aniversário da catástrofe nuclear na cidade ucraniana de Chernobil.
Este facto demonstra a utilização generalizada de antibióticos na criação de animais, e devo referir que os agricultores europeus estão fartos de serem os únicos a adoptar e a cumprir normas, correndo o risco de perderem rendimentos.
Este objectivo ambicioso não foi passível de concretização. Espero que os objectivos da UE 2020 sejam concretizados, nomeadamente o que se refere ao compromisso de a UE investir em I&D 3% do PIB em 2020. A UE 2020 não pode ficar à espera do próximo QFP.
Este projecto de relatório apoia, nas suas grandes linhas, a proposta da Comissão Europeia, nomeadamente no que respeita à necessidade de disponibilizar, em 1 de Janeiro de 2013, a banda dos 800 MHz libertada pela passagem para a televisão digital e a extinção total da radiodifusão analógica da televisão.
Este relatório de iniciativa é dedicado à questão da mobilidade dos jovens para fins de estudo, que decorre da estratégia "Europa 2020". É, sem dúvida, correcto aumentar a competitividade dos jovens através da criação de condições no quadro da educação universitária para que permaneçam pelo menos um ano noutro Estado-Membro. A mobilidade, um sistema de reconhecimento de créditos e outras medidas limitarão o aumento do desemprego entre os jovens, cuja taxa média na UE se situa actualmente em 21 %, o que é assustador.
Este relatório tem por objectivo estabelecer uma primeira posição do Parlamento no que respeita à produção de um novo Instrumento de financiamento da Cooperação para o Desenvolvimento, com base no Regulamento anterior.
Este é o momento não só de tentarmos compreender os problemas uns dos outros, mas também de respeitarmos as diferenças que existem entre nós. No início desta semana, manifestei claramente a minha opinião de que não seria responsável da parte do Parlamento entrar em confronto directo com o Conselho sobre uma questão que eu teria dificuldade em explicar ao cidadão comum.
Estes desenvolvimentos da situação social preocupam-no? São uma questão política relevante.
Estes são apenas grandes exemplos de patamares comuns entre os 27 Estados-Membros que motivam a presente iniciativa e fundamentam o meu voto favorável.
Estou ciente dos problemas de poluição mencionados neste relatório e levo-os muito a sério, mas impor mais taxas pela poluição atmosférica e sonora não é solução. O problema é muito maior do que o relatório deixa perceber.
Estou em contacto com o Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros do Egipto, Al-Araby, que está empenhado em trabalhar estreitamente connosco no processo de paz do Médio Oriente, que está disposto a fortalecer a nossa relação e a reconhecer-nos como parceiros a colaborar na região.
Está a ser promovido por elementos extremistas da diáspora tamil, que contribuíram para a manutenção da campanha terrorista da organização dos LTTE durante muitos anos através do activismo político, e muitas vezes com base nos rendimentos da criminalidade.
Eu dou três exemplos nos 20 segundos que me restam. O Conselho deve terminar a co-decisão sobre a reinstalação de refugiados que este Parlamento votou e que previa mecanismos de emergência para usar nestas ocasiões. Deve ser posta em cima da mesa a proposta de um corredor humanitário para retirar da Líbia refugiados creditados pelo ACNUR e a NATO deve cumprir o seu mandato que está na resolução de 1973, proteger população civil, o que quer dizer fazer salvamentos em alto mar. A omissão de auxílio, não esqueçamos, é um crime, e ele não deve ocorrer em nosso nome.
Exemplos como a cimeira de Copenhaga sobre as alterações climáticas, a resolução da Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas sobre o reforço dos direitos de participação - dou os meus parabéns à senhora baronesa Ashton - ou a participação da UE no Fundo Monetário Internacional evidenciam não só a necessidade de resolver estas questões, mas também de encontrar uma estratégia comum.
Existe, porém, algo que gostaria de dizer com toda a clareza: esses avanços são muitas vezes alcançados a nível dos especialistas.
Expressa, pela primeira vez, a vontade de 27 países quanto ao futuro da agricultura da UE.
Falou-me acerca dos problemas do E. coli nas frutas e produtos hortícolas nos Estados Unidos, e discutimos sobre o facto de essa não ser uma situação comum na União Europeia.
Fetos deformados, com órgãos excessivamente grandes, morreram nos ventres de animais utilizados para fins experimentais, outros nasceram mortos e outros pereceram apenas alguns dias após o nascimento. A clonagem é uma tirania pior para os animais do que as gaiolas pequenas ou o transporte em camiões, sem água.
Finalmente, mas não menos importante, em resposta ao senhor deputado Verhofstadt, é pouco sensato isolar qualquer Estado-Membro quando existe um conjunto de Estados-Membros que são contribuintes líquidos para o orçamento.
Foi com grande preocupação que acompanhei os escândalos de corrupção na Ucrânia e os julgamentos em que políticos são acusados de uma forma que é por vezes grotesca. A União está a ser muito cuidadosa na forma como comenta os acontecimentos na Ucrânia.
Foi por isso que o Parlamento Europeu quis reiterar a necessidade de investimentos acrescidos na educação e na formação. A abertura de programas de mobilidade europeus a todos os jovens, independentemente do seu percurso ou do seu estatuto social, é essencial para lhes proporcionar um melhor acesso ao mercado de trabalho. É chegado o momento de os Estados-Membros se comprometerem verdadeiramente a fim de assegurar uma formação de elevada qualidade a todos os jovens europeus.
Foram implementados mecanismos especializados em imigração e asilo, em parceria com instituições homólogas de outros Estados-Membros, a saber, Alemanha e Países Baixos, para a eventualidade de ocorrer um grande afluxo de imigrantes na fronteira.
Gostaria ainda de chamar a atenção da Assembleia para a seguinte questão: o debate sobre a boa execução ou não do orçamento deve ser acompanhado de um debate sobre a eficácia das políticas.
Gostaria de apresentar os meus agradecimentos à Senhora Comissária pelo facto de ter sido rapidamente emitida uma comunicação sobre a política comum de asilo e imigração, quando a Dinamarca quis introduzir controlos de fronteiras. Não obstante, temos de dar um outro passo. Não se trata apenas da questão de votar para aceitar a entrada da Roménia e da Bulgária no espaço Schengen.
Gostaria de explicar uma vez mais, Senhor Deputado Turmes, que se eu não tivesse assinado a versão revista e, a meu ver, mais positiva, dos critérios do teste, neste momento não teríamos nada.
Gostaria de o informar, Senhor Comissário, de que hoje recebemos notícias extremamente preocupantes de Nizhny Novgorod, onde a cimeira está prestes a iniciar-se.
